# Meeting notes

### June 11.

1. Open a couple of issues
2. Start documenting.

1. Create an image that executes pings to all other nodes
2. Then we scale the number of replicas up, and observe how that affects the response & bandwidth times.
3. Find out if cpu_limit is for clock_speed or for stress test.
4. Start with strongly connected network to observe how quickly the links/docker bridge gets saturated
5. Depending on the result of [4] we can start testing on other topologies that are more fog-friendly.
